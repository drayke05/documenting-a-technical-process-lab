# Installing a CPU on a Motherboard


## Goal ##
-By the end, you'll know how to install a CPU a step closer towards build a pc.


## What You'll Need ##
- Compatible CPU (Intel or AMD)
- Motherboard
- Clean and static-free workspace (Avoid Carpet)
- CPU Cooler and thermal paste, if not pre-applied

## Step-by-Step Instructions ##


### 1. Set Up Your Workspace ###
Make sure you're working in a clean area (not on carpet) to avoid static.

### 2. Locate CPU socket ###
Usually located in the center of the motherboard.
-For **Intel**, there's a metawl bracket you need to lift up.
For **AMD**, you lift the plastic lever next to the socket.

## 3. Line Up the CPU ##
Take the CPU out of the box, **holding it by the edges** (don't touch the bottom).
Look for the **little triangle** on one corner of the CPU — line it up with the triangle on the socket.

### 4. Place the CPU in the Socket ###
Gently place the CPU straight down into the socket. **Don’t force it.** If it’s lined up right, it should drop right in.

### 5. Lock It In ###
- For **Intel**, lower the metal bracket and push the arm down.
- For **AMD**, just lower the lever to lock it.

### 6. Appy Thermal Paste (If Needed) ###
If your cooler already has thermal paste on it, you can skip this.
If not, squeeze a **tiny dot** (like a pea) of thermal paste right in the center of the CPU.

### 7. Install the CPU Cooler ###
Place the cooler over the CPU and screw or clip it into place (depends on the type of cooler you have).
Then, connect the cooler’s fan cable to the motherboard header labeled **CPU_FAN**.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Wrong orientation:** Make sure the CPU triangle matches the socket triangle.
- **Too much thermal paste:** A little goes a long way.
- **Forcing the CPU:** Never press down hard — it should fit easily.
